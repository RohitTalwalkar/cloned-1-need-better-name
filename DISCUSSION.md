## TODOs

In priority order

1.) Change filtering to run on the server
2.) Change API (both Frontend and Backend) to paginated responses
3.) Add chips/filters to the table search, so that users can multi-select which specialties to find
4.) Link to scheduling flow - I assume some advocates will have an online portal to schedule appointments
5.) Add a zip-code / location / distance search to the table
6.) Sort results by "something" where "something" orders the advocates by best match
